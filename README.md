# Food Nutrition Analyzer

## Overview
The **Food Nutrition Analyzer** is a beginner-friendly Python project that analyzes the nutritional content of foods.  
It helps answer questions such as:

- Which foods are **high in protein**?  
- Which foods are **low in sugar**?  
- Which foods have **high fiber content**?  
- Which foods have the **best protein per calorie**?  
- Which foods are **high in fat and carbs**?  

This project is built using **Python** and **pandas**, making it an excellent example of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

## Dataset
The project uses a CSV file named `nutrients_csvfile.csv` containing nutritional information for a variety of foods.  
Columns include:

- Food  
- Protein  
- Calories  
- Carbs  
- Fiber  
- Fat  

*(Make sure the CSV is in the same folder as the Python file.)*
